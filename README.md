# A Commentary on Life

This project documents the process and final result of my first-ever attempt at
implementing Conway's Game of Life. I'll be using Rust for this implementation,
a decision motivated more by familiarity than anything else.

This repository contains two main elements, as follows:
1.  The source code of my implementation
2.  A [markdown file][md] (the "commentary") documenting my implementation
    adventure

Feel free to poke around the commit history to see what I did in chronological
orer - in fact, the commentary will be annotated with a notice every time I
make a commit so that you can follow along as I write it.

[md]: ./commentary.md
